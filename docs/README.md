# Initial Commit

For an initial commit of interesting items for this repro

## Hardware

### targets

* <http://makecode.com> with initial interest in the micro:bit

### LoRaWAN modules

* <http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/RN2483> as the RN2483 has previous work with micro:bit
* <http://www.embit.eu/products/wireless-modules/emb-lr1272> as the RN2483 is out of stock due to new version

### Boards

* <https://github.com/ribbotson/LoRaWAN_MicroBit> carrier for both micro:bit and LoRaWAN modules
* protoype carriers with just leads are also available to ensure access to POC's

## Software

## target

* <https://makecode.com/defining-blocks> allows for block creation as a quick implementation
* <https://pxt.microbit.org/packages> allow for the packaging of ttn: the final aim of pxt-ttn

## Application

* ttn is about creating a final application based on the inputs and outputs of a target
* some easy application creation is needed.

## Reference

* <https://github.com/ribbotson/MERL-Microbit> c++ for the ribootson board.
